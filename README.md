Simple way to manage project and show progress on Gantt chart, it is on web application and there is no limitation to use it, so if some part of your project are in sites where are far from each other, you can use it and gather real data from users who are involved to same project. When you are involved in a project, you have to control affairs; otherwise we will have to pay its consequences which may be serious. I have not seen a complete package for controlling project in free. I have prepared essential parts which are needed for monitoring project resources.
Background: What is Project Management?
Project is set of activities to improve and enhance products or services. People comes together temporarily to perform tasks which have specific start and end point until they can achieve desire result. Project control is to manage resources and have best feedback; goal in this area is to reach high quality in products or services in short time with at least cost. So we have a scope which can be changed overtime based on conditions.
