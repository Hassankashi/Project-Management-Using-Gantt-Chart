<h1>AJAX Control Toolkit &mdash; May 2011 Release</h1> 
 
<p> 
This release of the Ajax Control Toolkit focused on making fixes and improvements to the ModalPopup, AsyncFileUpload, and DropShadow controls:
</p> 

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>
    <b>ModalPopup</b> &mdash; The ModalPopup extender has been enhanced to support animations. 
    The ModalPopup now supports OnShowing, OnShown, OnHiding, OnHidden animations. For example, you can fade-in the popup when it opens and 
    fade-out the popup when it closes. Or, you can get super fancy with your animations.  
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    <b>AsyncFileUpload</b> &mdash; This release fixes several significant issues with the AsyncFileUpload. For example, previous to this release, 
    the AsyncFileUpload control did not work correctly in a master page or when ClientIDMode="static".
    In this release, the AsyncFileUpload has been enhanced to be HTML5 compatible and to work with Mozilla Firefox 4.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>DropShadow</b> &mdash; This release fixes an issue with the DropShadow extender which prevented it from working correctly in an UpdatePanel. This
    release also includes better test coverage for the DropShadow with the addition of new QUnit tests.
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>
